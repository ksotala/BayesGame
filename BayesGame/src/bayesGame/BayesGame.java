 * Class naming conventions:
 * 
 * This game attempts to follow a Model-View-Controller pattern. To keep things clear, the following naming conventions should be followed:
 * 
 * - MODEL classes should just be named after the thing they model, e.g. "Character".
 * - CONTROLLER classes should have "Controller" at the end, e.g. "CharacterController".
 * - VIEW classes should have "View" at the end, e.g. "CharacterPanelView".
 *
 * Please note that models are allowed to have extensive program logic inside them, as long as that
